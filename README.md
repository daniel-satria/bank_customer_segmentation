# Bank Customer Segmentation

# 1. BACKGROUND
**1.1 Project Background**

This project is made to fulfill the project for LPS POC.

**1.2 Dataset Background**

The dataset used in this project is the credit card customer from a specific bank.


# 2. PROJECT OBJECTIVE
**2.1 Objective**

In this notebook the writer will try to do customer segmentation.

**2.2 Project Objective Detail Steps**
To obtain the objective the writer will do the task within steps as follow :
- Getting insight from the dataset / EDA.
- Creating machine learning model and test it to our dataset to makes clustering of dataset.
- Creating model evaluation and model improvement.
- Drawing conclusion from overall milestone project.

**2.3 Notebook Disclaimer**
- The writer will mention title/explanation first, then later write the code.
- The title means to explain what writer did or tried to do with the code or to explain the output of the code itself.

# 10. Conclusion
- We could use these following model to cluster the customer : KMeans, Spectral Clustering, Gaussian Mixture.
- Based on this project respect to the dataset used, writer concluded ones could take consideration to use KMeans and Spectral Clustering to do segmentation.
- Three (3) clusters are the optimum number of cluster for the segentation respect to the dataset.
